Design Idea:
This NYC Birds Check is designed in order to help people to know how much dothey know about NYC's local birds. The questions are designed from easy to hard and a really hard question for the 8th question. 

I want this design for the quiz/survey look both nteresting and official.
In order to do that, I referenced the design of Google Survey.
The color choosen whs based on 5 colors, #5d5fef, #a5a6f6, #484acd, #a29fff, and #E7E7ff, as well as black, white, and some other color in purple.  Since I want the color looks clear, full of technology, and relaxing. Also the reason why I choose purple is that the yearly color of 2022 is purple. 
I also tried my best to use more %s in stead of pxs in css coding to make the website flexible in variousscreen sizes. 

Design proces:
I first designed the questo=ions, then a layout in Figma, then coding on the computer.
